# DeepDeception 

A Deep Learning-based web application for **deepfake video detection**, powered by the **Xception** model and deployed via **Railway**.  

---

##  Overview

**DeepDeception** uses a fine-tuned **Xception (Extreme Inception)** model to detect deepfakes from video uploads. The system is integrated into a **Django**-based web app with a clean user interface, a feedback submission form, and a backend database to store user feedback and email addresses.

##  Core Features

-  **Xception-based Deepfake Detection**  
  Trained and tuned on real vs fake video data (DFDC Dataset)

-  **Django Web App Interface**  
  Upload video files and get instant predictions

-  **Feedback System**  
  Users can submit feedback and emails, which are stored in a secure database

-  **Deployed on Railway**  
  Accessible online with scalable backend hosting

##  How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/DeepDeception.git
cd DeepDeception

pip install -r requirements.txt

python manage.py runserver
 Feedback System
Users can submit feedback through the web interface.

Submitted feedback and email addresses are stored securely in the backend database.

Admins can view and manage feedback entries via the Django admin panel (if enabled).
